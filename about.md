# About Me
Hello! I am Daniela.
I have a keen interest in biology, especially in understanding how living organisms function and interact with their environment. 
I am particularly fascinated by genetics, human anatomy, and ecosystems. 
My skills include scientific research, analyzing biological data, and clearly explaining complex ideas. 
One of my main goals is to deepen my knowledge of molecular biology and contribute to advances in medical science, such as developing treatments for genetic disorders or studying the spread of disease.
